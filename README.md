Team name: Yahooooo!

Members: Chris Chan, Shanshan Zhang, Sreenivas Kalva, Desmond Phan, Hemal Bavishi

Project Objective: Yahooooo! team  will undertake a portfolio assessment of 4 portfolio scenarios and provides a recommendation based on higher ROI. This portfolio assessment does not take into consideration other factors such as Risk/Volatility etc.

User inputs initial capital (such as A$10K), and the program uses 5-yr historial returns to calculate the current value of the investment.

•	Portfolio 1: User creates  own ASX stock portfolio. The user will be able to enter stock tickers.

•	Portfolio 2: Algorithm optimised stock portfolio (using python package PyPortfolioOpt using EfficientFrontier algorithm)

•	Portfolio 3: This is to assess "opportunity loss" if the sser decides to not invest but wants to benefit from bank provided interest rates. In this scenario, we will use RBA cash rates.

•	Portfolio 4: Crypto Asset - If the user invested 100% of the investment amount in Crypto (ETH/BTC/XRP) assets about 5-years ago.
